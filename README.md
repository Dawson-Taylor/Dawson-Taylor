## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dawson and I am learning game dev with Unity and modding Minecraft with NeoForge. 

ðŸ’¬ A little about me: In the middle of 2024 I had herniated my L5S1 disk and will have had surgery at the end of Jan 2025. This injury has caused me to realize I really need to focus on getting my dream career instead of working as an Auto Technician. I would like to get into game development with unity to learn c# and modding with minecraft to learn java. I have opened an orginaztion @CodeKanic and hope to one day turn it into a startup company or have it be my portfolio for future jobs. Thanks for checking out my profile and reading this. Any advice or free course suggestions would be very welcomed.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me at any of these links [Portfolio](https://dawsonsportfolio@codekanic.com), [X](https://x.com/DawsonWTaylor), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawson-w-taylor/) or check out my [itch.io](https://codekanic.itch.io/). For now itch.io will be where I post my developed games.
